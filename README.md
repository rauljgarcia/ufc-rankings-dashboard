UFC Rankings Dashboard (Automated)

This project automates my weekly workflow for tracking UFC rankings.

The UFC updates rankings irregularly (usually on Tuesdays), and manually copying rankings into a formatted spreadsheet each week was time-consuming and error-prone. This pipeline replaces that manual process with a repeatable script while preserving a print-ready Excel dashboard layout.

Overview

The project consists of three layers:
	1.	Data ingestion (Python)
	•	Scrapes the official UFC rankings page
	•	Parses all divisions and ranked fighters
	•	Checks whether the UFC has actually updated rankings
	•	Appends new data only when an update occurs
	2.	Historical storage (CSV)
	•	Append-only rankings history
	•	One row per fighter per division per UFC update
	•	Enables reliable tracking of rankings over time
	3.	Presentation (Excel)
	•	A formatted, print-ready dashboard
	•	Automatically updates when new data is added
	•	Designed for consistent front/back printing
	•	No manual cell editing required

The emphasis is on reliability and stability: the formatting never changes, and the data updates only when the rankings change.

Repository contents
	•	ufc_rankings_update.py
Main automation script. Fetches rankings, parses data, and appends new snapshots to history when appropriate.
	•	ufc_rankings_history.csv
Append-only historical rankings data generated by the script.
	•	ufc_rankings_dashboard.xlsx
Excel dashboard that reads from the history file and renders formatted views for printing.
	•	ufc_rankings_notebook.ipynb
Development notebook used during exploration and prototyping.

Data model

Each row in the history file represents one fighter in one division for a single UFC rankings update.

Key fields:
	•	snapshot_date – date the script was run
	•	ufc_last_updated – the “Last updated” date shown on the UFC rankings page
	•	division – weight class or ranking category
	•	champion – champion of that division
	•	fighter – ranked fighter name
	•	fighter_url – UFC athlete profile URL
	•	rank – numerical rank (1–15)
	•	rank_change – rank movement (+N, -N, NR, or blank)

The ufc_last_updated field is used to determine whether rankings have changed since the last saved snapshot.

How it works

At a high level:
UFC rankings page
        ↓
Python scraper (requests + BeautifulSoup)
        ↓
Parsed and validated rankings table
        ↓
Append-only CSV history
        ↓
Excel dashboard refresh

The script includes sanity checks to avoid writing partial or incorrect data if the page structure changes.

Running the script

From the project directory:
python ufc_rankings_update.py

Expected behavior:
	•	If the UFC has not updated rankings since the last saved snapshot:
Parsed 195 rows, 13 divisions, UFC updated YYYY-MM-DD
No UFC update since YYYY-MM-DD. Skipping append.

	•	If the UFC has updated rankings:
Parsed 195 rows, 13 divisions, UFC updated YYYY-MM-DD
Appended 195 rows for UFC update date YYYY-MM-DD.

Excel dashboard usage

Open ufc_rankings_dashboard.xlsx after running the script and refresh external data (or reopen the file). The formatted views update automatically while preserving all layout, spacing, and print settings.

The workbook is designed to be printed as two pages (front and back) per update.

Notes
	•	This project depends on the current HTML structure of ufc.com/rankings. If the UFC changes the markup, parsing logic may need to be updated.
	•	The script is designed to be run repeatedly without risking duplicate or corrupted data.
	•	The focus of this project is automation, reproducibility, and presentation stability rather than interactive visualization.
    •	The included Excel dashboard contains a single sample rankings snapshot for demonstration purposes.
